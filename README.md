# ELECTENG 209 Project Repository

This is a repository to be used by all team members to store your ELECTENG 209 project files.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this repository to store all of your project work, including your LTspice models, PCB design, firmware written with Atmel Studio, Proteus simulations, etc.

You may create as many folders and files as you wish.

To get started, you should:
1. Decide whether your team wishes to use the [advanced structure](./Advanced/) or the [basic structure](./Basic/).
2. Delete the folder that you choose *not* to use.
3. Move the inner folders (excluding the `README.md` file in the chosen `Basic/` or `Advanced/` folder) of your chosen structure to the top-level of the repository.
4. Delete the empty `Basic/` or `Advanced/` folder together with its `README.md` file.

## üóÉ Project Management

A variety of GitHub project management templates have been provided to you, which you may choose to use:
